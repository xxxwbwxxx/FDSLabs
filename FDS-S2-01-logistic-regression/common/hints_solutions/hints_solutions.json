Remember that zero corresponds to no change in the log odds. The value zero is close to the centre of the confidence intervals for the other attributes (independent variables), suggesting that they are not significant relationships. We could imagine dropping the attributes whose coefficients appear to be close to zero. There are also some coefficients that are correlated. For example, bootstrap samples with a high coefficient for Employed tend to have a lower `LogCreditScore`."
